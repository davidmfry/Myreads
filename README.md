#My Reads
My reads is my final project section 2 of the Udacity React Nanodegreee program.  My reads allows you to keep track of what books you are currently reading, want to read and have read. You have the ability to search for new books and add them you your shelfs.

The search section can only use specified [search terms](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md). 

The backend API was provided to me by Udacity.  I was responsible for all of the front end UI code using react.
